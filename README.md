# Rust Almond Client

This is a light-weight client for the [Almond Web API](https://wiki.almond.stanford.edu/api-references/web-almond)
implemented using Rust. It is designed for embedded clients with limited flash
storage and RAM.

Currently, it is a standalone application. In the future it might be a library
as well.

Almond is a research project led by Prof. Monica Lam, from Stanford University.
